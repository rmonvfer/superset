# Superset

**Goal:** 
Build the ultimate vibecoding experience for engineers. Go from beginner to Architect level as fast as possible. 

Start with: 
1. Opinionated setup process. Assuming you start from 0. 
2. Get extrememly productive with the lowest possible setup. 
3. Add a starting set with the ability to improve

Bets:
1. Parallel agents - Get around waiting. An architect level is a general that is highly leveraged.
2. Local first - Absolute speed and openess needs the minimal abstraction level.
3. Glue tools together - Only build custom if it serves the user experience. Assume tools come and out of the kit and the best engineers use the best tool at the time. 

Features: 
1. Use git worktree and parallelization
2. Manage projects and ping when done
3. Meta agent cobbling things together (charge for this if no API key) (Likely using claude code)

Optional: 
1. Built-in IDE
2.
